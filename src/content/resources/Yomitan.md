Yomitan is a pop-up dictionary for browsers. I would say this is the most essential tool for learning Japanese. It makes doing look-ups significantly faster which saves you a *lot* of time in the long run. In addition, it is required if you want to mine with Lapis or jp-mining-note.

If you're going to use even just one tool, make it this one.
