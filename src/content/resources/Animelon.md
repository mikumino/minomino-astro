While not my preferred method of watching anime with Japanese subtitles, Animelon provides a really easy way to just do it with as little fuss as possible. Just find something you like and watch, subtitles conveniently included and timed.

The trade-offs to the convenience include a rougher user interface and a fairly limited library. There hasn't been  I think it's great for people who want to at least try to get some anime immersion in but don't want to learn all the tools involved yet.
